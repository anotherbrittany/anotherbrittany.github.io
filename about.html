<h2>THE YEAR IS 1998.</h2>

<p><strong>I'm in middle school</strong>, sporting some fresh braces and some OH-SO-COOL bangs with no less than five cowlicks. (In retrospect, the bangs were always a bad decision, although I didn't know it at the time. Seriously, if there'd been a competition for the number of cowlicks a girl could have in her bangs, I would have taken home the gold...)</p>
<p>Anyway… It’s 1998, and I’m hating my advanced math classes, typing 80-90 words per minute, listening to an absolutely embarrassing amount of Savage Garden (that "cherry cola" song was my jam), and suffering through the hissing of AOL dial-up Internet every time I connect to the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>It’s 1998, and that’s important. Why? Because <strong><em>that’s the year I start teaching myself how to code</em></strong>.</p>

      <!-- Brittany Thompson circa 1986 -->
      <center><img src="img/babyme.jpg" alt="Brittany Thompson circa 1986" /><br /><em>Me, circa 1998<br />(give or take 12 years)</em></center>
<br /><br />
<p>While my family sleeps peacefully each night, I patiently wait for my AOL dialup to connect to the Internet -- the entire time, hoping my parents don’t wake up. As soon as I hear that familiar voice telling me I’ve got mail, my heart flutters; I know I’m now free to surf HTMLgoodies.com until the sun comes up, teaching myself basic HTML in Notepad.</p>

<p>This is my typical night in 1998. I frequently stay up until 4:00am or later on school nights, learning to create animated .gifs and basic tables — because that stuff was all the rage back then.</p>
<hr>
<h3>LEARNING TO CODE WAS A SLOW PROCESS.</h3>

<p>Very slow, although it never felt painfully slow. I was driven, not discouraged, but I also didn’t know many other coders. </p>

<p><em>Were there any female web designers? Were there any programmers my own age? Were there any in Kentucky, in the South, in the Midwest? Would there ever be?</em></p>

<p>In 1998, I had no answers to any of these questions. I just remember thinking to myself that this coding and web stuff was important. Websites and graphics and this thing called the Internet would change the world. </p>

<center>...AND MAYBE ONE DAY,<br /> 
I WOULD BE LUCKY ENOUGH <br />
TO GET PAID TO DO THIS 
FOR A LIVING...</center>
<hr>
