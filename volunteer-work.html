     <h1>Giving Back</h1>
     <p>I am a firm believer that if you have a little, you should give a little &#8212; and if you have a lot, you should give a lot. Over the past ten years, I&#8217;ve developed a strong passion for finding ways to give back, not just to my local communities but to others in need around the world. Each year, I volunteer my time and donate my money to various nonprofits and charities, and I also offer deeply discounted or sometimes free design and digital strategy services to nonprofits, charities and startups through my Pixels and Media firm. Helping make the world a better place has become a part of my personality and I hope to continue growing my philanthropic and volunteer efforts in the years to come.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways I&#8217;ve actively given back throughout the last decade:</p>

The site continues to gain new members and is already a valuable local resource, despite still being in &#8220;beta test&#8221; version.</p>
