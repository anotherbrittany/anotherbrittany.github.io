							<h2>Giving Back</h2>
							<p>I am a firm believer that if you have a little, you should give a little — and if you have a lot, you should give a lot. Over the past ten years, I’ve developed a strong passion for finding ways to give back, not just to my local communities but to others in need around the world. Each year, I volunteer my time and donate my money to various nonprofits and charities, and I also offer deeply discounted or sometimes free design and digital strategy services to nonprofits, charities and startups through my Pixels and Media firm. Helping make the world a better place has become a part of my personality and I hope to continue growing my philanthropic and volunteer efforts in the years to come.
<br /><br />
Here are some of the ways I’ve actively given back throughout the years:</p>
<p><strong>STEM Coding Instructor</strong><br />Winburn Middle School (2015)</p>
As a volunteer teacher for Winburn's Family Math Night, I gave five 20-min interactive classroom presentations to groups of up to 30 middle school students and their families. The topic was <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tenaciousbri/intro-to-stem-careers-for-middle-schoolers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Intro to STEM Careers by Brittany Thompson">An Intro to Coding, Web Design & STEM Careers for Middle Schoolers</a>, and included the basics of JavaScript for coding websites and video games, as well as a Q&A session for parents and students after each session.
<p><strong>Coding Instructor</strong><br />
Velocity Indiana (2014)</p>
Volunteered with the Velocity team to launch Kentuckiana's first official CoderDojo, teaching multiple classes of up to twelve girls and boys ages 7-14 (and sometimes even their parents!) how to write computer & website code and develop software, including custom video game mods. With a focus on JavaScript, I helped develop, plan, write curriculum for & teach the "Introduction to JavaScript Through Minecraft" coed course and a separate sold out girls-only version of the course. After developing curriculum, I trained initial classes in the fundamentals of JavaScript through modifying the popular video game Minecraft over a series of 6-week classes as well as a 4-week version of the classes. I assisted with training teaching aids and providing training materials and advice for other volunteer teachers for similar courses. Ultimately, the program was a success and we taught hundreds of Kentucky & Indiana children how to read & write code as well as basic video game development, website development and project planning skills over the course of 3 to 6 months. These classes received rave reviews from parents and students alike.
